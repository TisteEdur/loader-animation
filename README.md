# Loader Animation Recreation Exercise

<p>This is a repository for a loader animation that I saw for a game called "The Lost Glitches" on the Epic Games platform.</p>

<p>The loader is created with HTML, CSS and JavaScript.</p>

### Design
#### Shout out to [Epic Games & The Lost Glitches teams](https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/browse?q=the%20lost%20glitches&sortBy=relevancy&sortDir=DESC&count=40) for the design inspiraton!

<p>The main idea of the exercise was to recreate the loading/installing animation of the game on the Epic Games platform with JavaScript & CSS.</p>
